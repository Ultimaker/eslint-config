# Ultimaker ESLint Config

## Usage
To use this set of rules, simply create an `.eslintrc.js` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```js
module.exports = {
    extends: '@ultimaker/eslint-config',
};
```

You can then run your linting command as usual.

## Publishing
Publishing works the same way as we have implemented in [stardust-web](https://github.com/Ultimaker/stardust-web/blob/master/docs/publishing.md).
